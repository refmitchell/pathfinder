# Pathfinder configuration file

# Supported cues:
# light, requires a strength, elevation, and azimuth
# wind, requires a strength and a direction

# Example cue configuration
# cues:
#   light-0:
#     strength: 1
#     elevation: 45
#     azimuth: 90
#   wind-0:
#     strength: 1
#     direction: 45
#

# Stuff to note:
# All cues need a number (e.g. light-0) because their names have to be unique.
# All cues have to contain their type (e.g. wind, or light) so that the parser knows
# what objects to create.
# File structure is important, BACKUP THIS FILE in case it gets corrupted. None of the
# structure is error checked so I don't know how it will behave if the structure is
# wrong!
# Only valid parameter types will be incorporated, invalid ones will be ignored.

#
# First roll setup
#

# Optional settings (must be configured for both rolls independently!)
settings:
  # Display
  show-labels: True     # Show a label for each cue (matches the name given below)
  show-geometry: False   # Show the true geometric vectors used for cue computation.
  show-individual: True # Show the directional prompt for each individual cue as well as the combined.

  # Beetle
  combination-strategy: "avg" # Set combination strategy ("avg" will be the default if none configured)

# Mandatory (if the cues section is not present the software will not work)
