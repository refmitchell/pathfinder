Notes:
- Have basic world representation stuff in place
- Angles are messed up though. Spherical coordinates work perfectly but theta isn't
  really elevation, it's pi/2 - elevation.
  - Not really sure how to deal with this as converting back and forth could prove
    a problem.
- Also ran into problems with the representation of cues versus their strength.
  Internally, the strength is the vector magnitude but for visualisation the
  magnitude must be a unit vector (at least for lights).

Suggestions from meeting with Barbara:
- Doing things using basic vector geometry seems to be appropriate.
- Show the response for all cues present and then a combined response. This might
  be a much more practical way of solving the "strength" problem. We can see what would happen
  if all cues were weighted equally of if each was present alone.
- Add some noise to the signal, I understand the value in this but not really how to do it.
  The idea is to generate a distribution of responses which could model a population rather
  than generating a mean response. This was suggested as an additional requirement and not
  something to worry about immediately.
