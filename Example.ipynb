    "### Solar elevation thresholds and \"Stellar performance: Mechanisms underlying milky way orientation in dung beetles\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The paper \"Stellar performance: Mechanisms underlying Milky Way orientation in dung beetles\" (*Foster et al.* 2017 - referred to as \"the paper\") provides some experimental results which demonstrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The inability of nocturnal dung beetles (*Scarabaeus satyrus*) to orient to arbitrary patterns of light.\n",
    "2. A link between the observable contrast (Michelson contrast) in the sky and orientation performance. Higher Michelson contrast gave more accurate orientation. Orientation performance degrades as Michelson contrast is reduced and disappears entirely at sufficiently low contrast levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results here indicate that dung beetles do not use a generic pattern matching system to orient themselves (image matching using their dorsal eyes) and that they instead use an intensity gradient system to orient themselves. That is, they 'record the azimuth of either the brightest point or strongest intensity gradient' and then attempt to match this with their current view. In terms of light cues, this system is functionally identical to the centroid-vector (CV) system suggested by Ramsey El-Naggar in 2018. *El-Naggar* cites the asymmetrical elevation patterns (High Elevation and Low Elevation below) as being the only experimental conditions which may refute a CV system. \n",
    "\n",
    "### CV and intensity gradient equivalence\n",
    "To take the direction of the intensity gradient you must ascertain direction of average intensity as this will be drawn towards the brightest point in the visual field. In a real image this is done by computing the centre-of-mass of the image and computing a vector from the centre of the image to the centre-of-mass; this is the Centroid Vector. By computing the CV, you are computing the direction of the strongest intensity gradient in the sky. Therefore the CV model proposed by *El-Naggar* and the intensity gradient model proposed by *Foster et al.* are functionally identical.\n",
    "In Pathfinder, we can do this by using the cue averaging combination strategy (where we compute the combined cue vector by averaging all cue geometry vectors) with only light cues present. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing the claim\n",
    "In particular, I wanted to check my intuition that the change in CV observed in the Low Elevation and High Elevation scenarios would be minimal (i.e. that the combined cue confidence was sufficiently small or zero). I wished to demonstrate that, while *El-Naggar* was correct in stating that the CV would be affected, the effect would be so small as to be potentially undetectable to the beetle. \n",
    "\n",
    "By plugging light arrangements from the paper into Pathfinder using the average (avg) cue combination strategy, we get the following plots. Cue confidence threshold is chosen (arbitrarily - more on this below) as 0.2. All configuration files are provided in the configurations directory. All configuration files are provided in the configurations directory, insert the filename for the `configuration_file` variable in the general notebook and run the two application cells to view interactive plots and precise terminal output. The reader should note that the combined cue vector and centroid vector are equivalent in the follwing discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### High Elevation (HE)\n",
    "Config: high-elevation.yaml (pattern rotated by 90$^\\circ$, combined cue confidence for both rolls ~0.03)\n",
    "![High Elevation](img/HE.png)\n",
    "#### Low Elevation (LE)\n",
    "Config: low-elevation.yaml (pattern rotated by 90$^\\circ$, combined cue confidence for both rolls ~0.04)\n",
    "![Low Elevation](img/LE.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As expected (and hoped) all of these light arrangements give similar, low confidence in their combined cue vectors (equivalent to minimal change in CV). As LE and HE did give some confidence measure greater than 0 and I thought it prudent to try and find out what we could reasonably expect the minimum confidence measure to be. In essence, how long \n",
    "does the combined cue vector need to be in order to provide information which is sufficiently salient to orient. The contrast experiments given by *Foster et al.* may give us an estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting a minimum confidence threshold\n",
    "We can now attempt to recover a minimum confidence threshold by defining a light arrangement which gives the minimum required contrast for orientation. When measuring contrast the paper specifically chooses Michelson contrast measured between the northen and southern arms of the Milky Way band, which is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_{S/N} = \\frac{(I_S - I_N)}{(I_S + I_N)} = \\frac{(I_{max} - I_{min})}{(I_{max} + I_{min})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $I_S$ and $I_N$ are given as the *radiance* of the points in the southern and northern arms of the Milky Way respectively. As a side note, when looking at external sources for clarification, Michelson contrast seems to be given in terms of *luminance* and the general formula is defined in terms of maximum luminance and minimum luminance in a scene ($I_{max}$ and $I_{min}$). Given that we are just trying to replicate the Michelson contrast using Pathfinder cue strengths, I do not think this is a problem but it is worth mentioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we produce an arrangement of lights in Pathfinder with the minimum Michelson contrast reqiured for orentation (13%), then we should get a theoretical minimum confidence threshold required for successful orientation in general. In addition, we should also be able to define an upper bound on light elevation assuming that elevation is coupled to the perceived strength of a light cue. We can find the required strengths by trial and error. Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I_{max} = 2$$\n",
    "$$I_{min} = 1.53$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_{S/N} = \\frac{2 - 1.53}{2 + 1.53} = \\frac{0.47}{3.53} = 0.1331444... \\simeq 0.13 \\rightarrow 13\\%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I produced a light arrangement based on those presented in the paper. That is, eight lights in a band from North West to South East at elevations 30$^\\circ$, 45$^\\circ$, 60$^\\circ$, and 75$^\\circ$ on each side. One side is then reduced in strength to introduce contrast. In my case the four lights on the northern side were reduced in strength (though all four were the same strength). Replicating the light arrangement from the paper is important as altering the elevation of the lights present will change the combined cue confidence observed. If we were simply to take two lights placed 180$^\\circ$ apart with strengths $I_{max}$ and $I_{min}$ a lower elevation would give a greater combined cue confidence than a higher one; therefore, copying the light arrangement precisely is important for an accurate estimation. The configuration file is provided as minimum-contrast.yaml and the following plot and output is produced:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Minimum Contrast](img/MC.png)\n",
    "![MC Terminal Output](img/MCTerm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us an estimate for the lower threshold for combined cue confidence as 0.137 (rounded to 0.14). If this threshold is accurate (and exists), the combined cue confidence given by the HE and LE configurations is far too low. Even though the CV position is affected, the resultant magnitude is well below the estimated threshold required for orientation. Thus, a CV/intensity gradient system is still highly plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating maximum light elevation\n",
    "When testing the light elevation patterns it was noted that there is currently nothing in the literature which explicitly tests the effects of light elevation on beetle orientation performance. That is, lab experiments in which beetles are tested under light elevations which are gradually increased from 0$\\circ$ to 90$\\circ$ and their performance recorded. Experiments **do** exist which measure the orientation performance under the natural sky (*Dacke et al. 2014*) however these experiments were designed to test relative influence of sunlight and skylight polarisation at different elevations, not elevation alone. These experiments do note that performance degraded at elevations above 75$^\\circ$ which is worth bearing in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the contrast test used above, we may be able to extrapolate the maximum light elevation at which orientation is possible in dung beetles. We should note that these results are drawn from experiments on *Scarabaeus satyrus*, a nocturnal dung beetle species. We do not have contrast measurements for diurnal dung beetles and their sensitivity to contrast may be drastically different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we can simply use trial and error to find the light elevation which gives a cue confidence of greater than our proposed threshold, 0.14. The azimuth parameter here is irrelevant, but the strength and elevation are important. In my test case I used strength 1 but increasing the strength would increase the confidence for a given elevation. It is not known if this matches reality but I find it unlikely; especially at high elevations I would think that a brighter light would make orientation more difficult, however I am not aware of any data on the subject. With strength 1 we find that an elevation of 81.9$^\\circ$ provides a cue confidence of 0.1409 $\\gt$ 0.14 (figure and terminal output below - config file: max-elevation.yaml). The azimuth was not changed between rolls as it would have provided no further information.\n",

    "![ME Terminal Output](img/METerm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The theoretical thresholds for cue confidence and light elevation suffer from a synthetic level of precision but I think it would be interesting to know if the maximum light elevation which can be used for orientation is sufficiently close to 82$^\\circ$, at least in a nocturnal beetle. The number seems plausible, as we do know that orientation abilities in the diurnal beetles degrade at elevations greater than 75$^\\circ$ (*Dacke et al. 2014*), but it seems they were still able to orient (albeit poorly). An indoor lab experiment with a finer level of granularity could show that population orientation error moves towards a random distribution above a certain elevation. Similarly, it would be interesting to examine whether luminance (strength) has an impact on orientation capability and also if this effect is dependent on elevation; a brighter light may be more useful at extremely low elevations and a dimmer light at extremely high elevations; I had not considered this before writing this example.
