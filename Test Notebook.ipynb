    "Below you'll find a cell containing a configuration file. This allows you to change some global settings which will affect the display or functionality as well as configuring the cue layout for each \"roll\". Once your configuration is set up, click \"Cell -> Run All\" on the toolbar above. This will ensure your configuration is properly saved and run the software with that configuration. This should generate a sequence of plots showing the different 3D cue setups as well as the familiar 2D plots which follow the conventions of the literature. Try running the software without modifying the configuration, a basic demo scenario is set up by default.\n",
