# Pathfinder: a tool for predicting dung beetle menotactic behaviour #
## Requirements ##
- Anaconda (Python 3.7 version) (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

## Setup ##
Clone the repository to a location of your choice, we'll call this INSTALL_DIR.

Once you have Anaconda installed you need to create a virtual environment. On
linux use:

`$: conda create --name pathfinder`

Once you have created your virtual environment, activate it with:
`$: conda activate pathfinder`

You need to install matplotlib, numpy, and jupyterlab to use the tool. These
can be installed with:
`$: conda install numpy matplotlib jupyterlab`

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application from
INSTALL_DIR/pathfinder with:
`$: jupyter notebook`

The notebook should explain the rest!

You can deactivate the virtual environment with:
`$: conda deactivate`
