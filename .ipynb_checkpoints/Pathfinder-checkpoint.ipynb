    "The software must be configured (via a configuration file) before it can be run. The configuration information is stored in a separate configuration file which we can't currently open in Jupyter Notebooks (though I'm working on it). The default file is located at &lt;Project Root&gt;/configurations/config.yaml. The file is written in the YAML format (https://yaml.org/) and an example is shown below (see Configuration). Once the configuration is complete the software can be run from here by selecting \"Cell -> Run All\" from the menu above. The software will display four plots:\n",

    "This image shows a simple setup in which a single light cue is displaced by 180$^{\\circ}$ for the second roll. We simulate the scenario where the beetle performs two rolls and the cue placement is changed for the second roll. The first roll is shown in the left column and the second in the right. The top row shows a 3D representation of the world which can be rotated (left-click and drag) and enlarged (right-click and drag up/down) allowing the user to see the 3D spatial relationship of the different cues. The bottom row shows a top-down view similar to those commonly used in the literature which gives a clear image of the simulated beetle's chosen direction in both rolls and how they differ. Legends are provided per row. Terminal output is also given with the exact numbers. In the first roll the simulated beetle always choses to move towards 0$^{\\circ}$ (mimicking the angular normalisation commonly used in the literature) which allows us to see the bearing change clearly on the graph. The radii of the hemispheres and circles are all 1."

    "\n",
    "## How does the beetle get its bearing? \n",
    "The beetle always uses a single ***combined cue*** to determine its bearing. All cues present will be combined by using a ***combination strategy***. Every cue is represented in software by two vectors: the ***world vector*** which describes the cue's position in the 3D world and the ***geometry vector*** which provides the true geometric description of the cue which is used to determine the combined cue. As a quick example of the distinction, consider two point-source light cues (green orbs) in the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Geometry Vector Example](img/GeoVectorExamples.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image light-0 is twice as strong as light-1, however it wouldn't make sense to draw light-0 twice as far away. The geometry vectors (grey) show the vectors which will actually be combined to generate the combined cue (red). In this case the combination strategy takes the mean of all cues. Finally, the combined cue is **always** taken as the projection of the result of the combination strategy onto the ground as this gives us a direction reference as well as a measure of ***confidence*** intrinsic to the combined cue (its magnitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration\n",
    "Configuration is performed via an external YAML file (see Usage) at &lt;Project Root&gt;/pathfinder/configurations/config.yaml. A copy of the default configuration file is shown below for reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** At the minute this file may not contain tab ('\\t') characters. I don't currently have a fix for this as tabs are not supported by YAML. The easiest way to avoid this problem is to make sure your text editor replaces tabs with some number (e.g. 2) of spaces."

    "### Cue scaling\n",
    "To represent an intrinsic preference for a particular type of cue I have included the cue-strength-scaling settings. These act as direct multipliers to the strength property of each cue (of the given type) across both rolls. The scaling factors allow us to see how behaviour changes under the same cue setup if the beetle is more or less sensitive to different types of cue. Scaling can be used to implement hierarchy (high scaling on preferred cue types), weighting (all cue types have a weight between 0 and 1 which must sum to 1), or gain (simple amplification of arbitrary cue types) but it is up to the user to ensure the values given are consistent and make sense. No checking is performed, except in the case of negatives.\n",

If a value is given which is invalid the software will most likely crash but may produce some odd results; for example, if a negative strength is given for a light cue and cue labelling is enabled, the light cue will not be present in the world but the label will appear at its elevation and azimuth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cue consistency\n",
    "The software will **not** check that the cue configurations between runs are sensible. For example if only light is used in the first run and only wind is used in the second run, the software will happily state that the beetle will respond to the wind direction when in reality you couldn't expect the beetle to extract the same bearing from a totally different set of cues. Again, it is up to the user to make sure the cue configurations given are somehow consistent between runs. There was no obvious way to perform this check at the granularity of a cue as lights may be added or removed to change the relative (or absolute) intensity pattern observed, however, a future addition may be to implement this check between cue types (e.g. only cue types present in the first roll may be present in the second)."

    "\n",
    "### Plots ###\n",
    "#### Cue types\n",
    "This example shows how different cue types are displayed. Lights are represented as green orbs with a size proportional to their strength (stronger light -> bigger orb). Wind cues are shown using blue vectors positioned above the world which point in the direction that the wind is blowing.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Individual cue vectors\n",
    "Setting show-individual to True results in the brown vectors on the ground. These represent the cue vector given if only that cue were being considered (i.e. each cue's geometry vector projected onto the ground). These give an idea of the directional \"pull\" given by each cue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence threshold\n",
    "The confidence threshold is shown only in the top-down plots. This shaded grey circle represents the minimum confidence required for successful orientation. If the combined cue tip is within the grey circle then we expect that the beetle would not have sufficient directional information to orient itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cue confidence (2D)\n",
    "In the 2D plots, the combined cue magnitude is limited to 1, otherwise it would run off the plot and the tip would be obscured. The true combined cue vector is shown in the 3D plots and the magnitude is printed at the console (see below). It was assumed that a combined cue vector of length &gt;= to 1 provided more than enough directional information for orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A note on the graphics\n",
    "With all options enabled and multiple cues the plots quickly become difficult to read. Labelling can help up to a point but can also add to the problem. In certain circumstances, vectors may overlap and obscure eachother (depending on the order they're drawn) making it difficult (or sometimes impossible) to see some of the information displayed. It's worth bearing this in mind when configuring the display settings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Irritatingly, matplotlib will auto-scale the 3D plots which can skew the display (e.g. making light orbs appear far larger than they should be or fumbling the aspect ratio). This doesn't have a functional effect but again it can make the plots hard to read. Similarly the legends can be obscured if the matplotlib window isn't large enough. I always view the plots full screen on a landscape oriented monitor (all images in this notebook were produced with that setup).\n",

    "The console output is largely self explanatory. The project root and configuration file path are displayed, optional configuration information is displayed, and finally the output is displayed. I give confidence in the combined cues for both rolls and the absolute change in bearing. Higher confidence indicates more directional information, confidence less than the confidence-threshold indicates an inability to orient. Sufficiently low confidence may mean the absolute change in bearing is meaningless or a weak indication of behaviour.\n",

    "## Example use case: Solar elevation thresholds and \"Stellar performance: Mechanisms underlying milky way orientation in dung beetles\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Until reading this paper, I was under the impression that the cue orientation results observed thus far (in all published research up to 2017) could be explained by a generic pattern matching system. The Stellar performance paper (\"the paper\" herein) presents results which rule this out and made me think that the solution is instead a centroid-vector type system where existing signals are averaged to give a single directional reference. This strategy is functionally identical to the one suggested by the paper which proposes (amongst others) an intensity gradient based strategy where the beetles 'record the azimuth of either the brightest point or strongest intensity gradient' and then attempt to match this with their current view.\n",
    "\n",
    "To take the direction of the intensity gradient you must ascertain direction of average intensity as this will be drawn towards the brightest point in the visual field. In a real image this is done by computing the centre-of-mass of the image and computing a vector from the centre of the image to the centre-of-mass (the centroid vector). By computing the centroid vector, you are computing the direction of the strongest intensity gradient. In Pathfinder, we can do this by using the cue averaging combination strategy (where we take the combined cue vector by averaging all cue geometry vectors) with only light cues present. In particular, I wanted to check my intuition that the contrast observed in the low elevation and high elevation scenarios would be minimal (i.e. that the combined cue confidence was sufficiently small or zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "By plugging light arrangements from the paper into Pathfinder using the average (avg) cue combination strategy, we get the following plots. Cue confidence threshold is chosen (arbitrarily - more on this below) as 0.2. All configuration files are provided in the configurations directory. Just insert the filename for the `configuration_file` variable above and run the two application cells to view interactive plots and precise terminal output.\n",

    "#### Uniform Intensity (UI)/Symmetric cues\n",
    "Config: uniform-intensity.yaml (pattern rotated by 90$^\\circ$, combined cue confidence for both rolls ~0)\n",

    "\n",
    "As expected (and hoped) all of these light arrangements give similar, low confidence in their combined cue vectors. It is worth noting that for the ZC and UI configurations the confidence is zero within a floating point rounding error, hence the approximation. The HE and LE confidence measures are simply rounded. LE and HE did give some confidence measure greater than 0 and I thought it prudent to try and find out what confidence measure is given for the contrast threshold of 13% reported by the paper. I am awaiting clarification on some of the results but for now we will continue with the understanding that an intensity gradient **is** crucial and used as the main cue. \n",

    "When measuring contrast the paper specifically chooses Michelson contrast measured between the northen and southern arms of the Milky Way band, which is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C_{S/N} = \\frac{(I_S - I_N)}{(I_S + I_N)} = \\frac{(I_{max} - I_{min})}{(I_{max} + I_{min})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $I_S$ and $I_N$ are given as the *radiance* of the points in the southern and northern arms respectively. As a side note, when looking at external sources for clarification, Michelson contrast seems to be given in terms of *luminance* and the general formula is defined in terms of maximum luminance and minimum luminance in a scene ($I_{max}$ and $I_{min}$). Given we are just trying to synthesise the contrast, I do not think this is an issue but it is worth mentioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we produce an arrangement of lights in Pathfinder with the same Michelson contrast (13%) then we should get a theoretical minimum confidence threshold required for menotaxis. From this, we should also be able to define an upper bound on light elevation assuming that elevation is coupled to the perceived strength of a light cue. We can find the required strengths by trial and error. Let:\n",

    "\n",
    "I produced a light arrangement based on those presented in the paper. That is, eight lights as arranged in the zero contrast condition, with one side reduced in brightness to introduce contrast. In my case the four lights on the northern side were dimmed (but all even in strength). The light arrangement is important, as altering the elevation of the lights present will change the confidence threshold observed (tested by placing two lights at the same elevation, 180^$\\circ$ apart, altering the elevation, and observing the confidence changes). The configuration file is provided as minimum-contrast.yaml and the following plot is produced:\n",

    "This gives us an idea of the possible lower threshold for combined cue confidence as 0.137 (rounded to 0.14). From this, we may be able to extrapolate the maximum light elevation at which orientation is possible in dung beetles. We should note that these numbers are drawn from experiments on *Scarabaeus satyrus*, a nocturnal dung beetle species. We do not have contrast measurements for diurnal dung beetles and their sensitivity may be drastically different.\n",
